# Data Storage Within IoT Architectures

## Problem Statement

To make it simple: data store within the "Internet of Things" is hard right now.  

* You can put your data on the "thing," but you could lose your data, so that's a bad plan.
* You can put your data on the "cloud," but then you have to spend a lot of money, so that's a bad plan.

We need a better plan to store our big huge lot of IoT data.
